pre-commit/action
=================

a GitHub action intended to run [before-commit](https://github.com/before-commit/before-commit) and [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit).

## Work in progress

This action is still in development as it was forked by a vulnerable base. Please be careful before using it! Use it at your own risk.
